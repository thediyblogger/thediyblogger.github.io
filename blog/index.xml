      <description>What are Pinterest Group Boards Pinterest Group Boards are very similar to regular boards. The main difference is a group board has more than one collaborator.
Some group boards are very open to new contributors, and will have hundreds of members contributing pins. Other group boards may be more strict on who can contribute and may consist of only a handful of contributors. The decision on who can contribute to a group board is left to the owner of the board.</description>

      <description>A Pinterest board name can be up to 100 characters long. But be careful about using all that. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why, but first, let&amp;rsquo;s go through how to create a well optimized board name.
Forget Cutesy or Creative! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with those cute or creative board names. You know the ones I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. The boards that you really want to name &amp;ldquo;Food for Thought&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Mr Clean&amp;rdquo;. Sounds fun but it only makes sense to you and will perform very poorly in search.</description>

      <description>Why should I claim my website on Pinterest? Claiming your website on Pinterest is a very important step on your way to driving crazy traffic to your website. You need to have a claimed (and verified) website before you can apply for Rich Pins on your site. You need a claimed website to also gain invaluable analytics from Pinterest about how pins are doing sending traffic to your website. This data can be used to make critical decisions on how to build and target your future pins to drive more traffic.</description>

      <description>What are Rich Pins? Rich Pins are essentially a more enhanced version of a regular pin. They will scour your website for extra information, and upgrade the look of your pin with all that wonderful information.
For example, if you have a recipe post, then details about your recipe such as the ingredients can be pulled right into the pin itself.
This has the effect of giving your potential audience more information to look at when they view your pin.</description>

      <description>If you have a website that you want to drive insane amounts of traffic to, it is critical that one of the first steps you do is set up a Pinterest Business Account.
If you are new to Pinterest, then the first lesson is to realize that Pinterest is a search engine. It&amp;rsquo;s not a social website (like Twitter or Facebook). It&amp;rsquo;s not just an idea&amp;rsquo;s tool to save your bookmarks.</description>

      <description>If you found this page, you probably found it through Pinterest. If you came here via Google, then awesome.
I have been building and designing websites for over 15 years. In that time, most website optimization has been focused on Google and specifically Google SEO. This is normally fine if your website domain has been around for many years, and has established domain authority, or there are a lot of back links coming back into your website.</description>

      <description>BLOGGING 101 Lets start with the basics of Blogging. The word blog originally comes from the term
web-log (noun): a log (or diary) on the web (internet).  These days, blogging is more about having a regularly updated web site, written in an informal or conversational style. What you are currently reading is a blog.
You may have heard of WordPress, which is one of the most popular blogging platforms available.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first post on SEO and SEM.
Many customers feel that if you build a beautiful website, then customers will come pouring through the door.
In reality, there is more to [great website design](https://www.thediyblogger.com/blog/why-great-web-design-is-more-than-just-pretty-pictures/) than just pretty fonts, colors, and great imagery.
Users who search for certain keywords on Google or Pinterest will likely find your website only if you rank high on those keywords, giving you the opportunity to convert those users into potential paying customers.</description>

Global Popularity
You want your website to get as much high quality juice as possible to boost your page rank.</description>

      <title>Why great Web Design is more than just pretty pictures</title>

      <description>But, what is a Beautiful Web Design?
Web Design constitutes many aspects. These are the qualities we think are important (and beautiful) when building a website:
 Easy to use Familiarity Balanced Fast to load Easy to read and understand Friendly to the eye  Think about other products you may have used that are not intuitive or easy to use? Why can a two year old child easily figure out how to use an iPad, but they cant figure out the cable remote?</description>

      <title>Why your business needs a CDN</title>
      <link>https://www.thediyblogger.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-cdn/</link>

      <guid>https://www.thediyblogger.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-cdn/</guid>
      <description>For example, lets say your website was hosted on a server in Atlanta GA. Then, whenever your customer requested your website that did not use a CDN, the request would always come to your server in Atlanta. Local customers may have a decent experience because they are local, but requests from customers on the west coast would have to travel the span of the US. Even worse for global customers.</description>

      <description>SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a deprecated technology, now replaced by a newer acronym - TLS. TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. But you will often hear people talking about SSL or TLS interchangeably.
Okay, enough of this technical gobbledygook! What do all these fancy words mean?!?! In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s all about security on the internet.
When you visit your bank website, or these days even Facebook and Google, you will see a lock icon next to the URL in the address bar.</description>

      <description>You should be familiar with the Address Bar in your browser. It looks something like this:
  Address Bar   When your users go to a URL such as &amp;ldquo;www.drawbuildplay.com&amp;rdquo;, the request will go to a DNS server which routes the request to the correct place where your website is hosted. Think of it like regular mail you send through the post office. You send a letter marked with the recipients address.</description>
