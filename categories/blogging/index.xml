      <description>Regardless of what niche your blog is about, it is super important you have some standard legal pages on your blog to protect yourself.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you are running a business, or are just out there giving free advice, or are a lifestyle blogger. You have an audience who are visiting your blog and reading your content.
If for whatever reason, one of those readers followed your advice but was met with an unfortunate consequence, then they may try to sue you for any damages caused.</description>

      <description>BLOGGING 101 Lets start with the basics of Blogging. The word blog originally comes from the term
web-log (noun): a log (or diary) on the web (internet).  These days, blogging is more about having a regularly updated web site, written in an informal or conversational style. What you are currently reading is a blog.
You may have heard of WordPress, which is one of the most popular blogging platforms available.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first post on SEO and SEM.
Many customers feel that if you build a beautiful website, then customers will come pouring through the door.
In reality, there is more to [great website design](https://www.thediyblogger.com/blog/why-great-web-design-is-more-than-just-pretty-pictures/) than just pretty fonts, colors, and great imagery.
Users who search for certain keywords on Google or Pinterest will likely find your website only if you rank high on those keywords, giving you the opportunity to convert those users into potential paying customers.</description>

      <description>By this time, you should have already optimized your website with the Basic SEO Techniques I outlined in my previous post.
Never fear. There are a few things we can do to get started. But before we do, here is a term we will refer to a lot. &amp;ldquo;Link Juice&amp;rdquo;. Link juice is the amount of &amp;ldquo;juice&amp;rdquo; that one page can send to another.
Global Popularity
You want your website to get as much high quality juice as possible to boost your page rank.</description>

      <description>But, what is a Beautiful Web Design?
Web Design constitutes many aspects. These are the qualities we think are important (and beautiful) when building a website:
 Easy to use Familiarity Balanced Fast to load Easy to read and understand Friendly to the eye  Think about other products you may have used that are not intuitive or easy to use? Why can a two year old child easily figure out how to use an iPad, but they cant figure out the cable remote?</description>

      <title>Why your business needs a CDN</title>
      <link>https://www.thediyblogger.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-cdn/</link>

      <guid>https://www.thediyblogger.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-cdn/</guid>
      <description>For example, lets say your website was hosted on a server in Atlanta GA. Then, whenever your customer requested your website that did not use a CDN, the request would always come to your server in Atlanta. Local customers may have a decent experience because they are local, but requests from customers on the west coast would have to travel the span of the US. Even worse for global customers.</description>

      <description>SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a deprecated technology, now replaced by a newer acronym - TLS. TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. But you will often hear people talking about SSL or TLS interchangeably.
Okay, enough of this technical gobbledygook! What do all these fancy words mean?!?! In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s all about security on the internet.
When you visit your bank website, or these days even Facebook and Google, you will see a lock icon next to the URL in the address bar.</description>

      <description>You should be familiar with the Address Bar in your browser. It looks something like this:
  Address Bar   When your users go to a URL such as &amp;ldquo;www.drawbuildplay.com&amp;rdquo;, the request will go to a DNS server which routes the request to the correct place where your website is hosted. Think of it like regular mail you send through the post office. You send a letter marked with the recipients address.</description>
