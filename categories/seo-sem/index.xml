      <description>If you found this page, you probably found it through Pinterest. If you came here via Google, then awesome.
I have been building and designing websites for over 15 years. In that time, most website optimization has been focused on Google and specifically Google SEO.

Users who search for certain keywords on Google will likely find your website only if you rank high on Google, giving you the opportunity to convert those users into potential paying customers.</description>

      <description>By this time, you should have already optimized your website with the Basic SEO Techniques I outlined in my previous post.
Never fear. There are a few things we can do to get started. But before we do, here is a term we will refer to a lot. &amp;ldquo;Link Juice&amp;rdquo;. Link juice is the amount of &amp;ldquo;juice&amp;rdquo; that one page can send to another.
Global Popularity
You want your website to get as much high quality juice as possible to boost your page rank.</description>
