      <description>What are Rich Pins? Rich Pins are essentially a more enhanced version of a regular pin. They will scour your website for extra information, and upgrade the look of your pin with all that wonderful information.
For example, if you have a recipe post, then details about your recipe such as the ingredients can be pulled right into the pin itself.
This has the effect of giving your potential audience more information to look at when they view your pin.</description>
