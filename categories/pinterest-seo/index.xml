      <description>If you have a website that you want to drive insane amounts of traffic to, it is critical that one of the first steps you do is set up a Pinterest Business Account.
If you are new to Pinterest, then the first lesson is to realize that Pinterest is a search engine. It&amp;rsquo;s not a social website (like Twitter or Facebook). It&amp;rsquo;s not just an idea&amp;rsquo;s tool to save your bookmarks.</description>

      <description>If you found this page, you probably found it through Pinterest. If you came here via Google, then awesome.
I have been building and designing websites for over 15 years. In that time, most website optimization has been focused on Google and specifically Google SEO. This is normally fine if your website domain has been around for many years, and has established domain authority, or there are a lot of back links coming back into your website.</description>
